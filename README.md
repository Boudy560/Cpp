# c++ language
## what is c++ ?
C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.

C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.

C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.


## why c++ ?
C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.

C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.

C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.

C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.

C++ is fun and easy to learn!

As C++ is close to C, C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa. 
## Data type for c++
* int   // integer numbers 
* double // floating point numbers 
* float // floating point  numbers 
* string  // text 
* char // one character
  
* bool // boolean used for true or false 

## The data type specifies the size
|DataType|Size|Description|
|-----|-----|-----|
|int |2 or 4 bytes|Stores whole numbers, without decimals|
|double| 8 bytes |Stores fractional numbers, containing one or more decimals. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits|
|float|4 bytes |Stores fractional numbers, containing one or more decimals. Sufficient for storing 6-7 decimal digits|
|boo|1 bytes |Stores true or false values|
|char|1 bytes|Stores a single character/letter/number, or ASCII values|

# c++ operators 
* Arithmetic operators
* Assignment operators
* comparison operators
* logical  operators
* bitwise  operators

## Arithmetic operators
|Operator|Name|Description|Example|
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|+ |Addition|Adds together two values| x + y |
|-|Subtraction|Subtracts one value from another| x - y|
|*|Multiplication|Multiplies two values| x * y |
|/|Division|Divides one value by another| x / y |
|%|Modulus|Returns the division remainder| x % y |
|++|Increment| 	Increases the value of a variable by 1| ++x|
|--|Decrement|Decreases the value of a variable by 1| --x|

 ## Assignment operators 
|Operator|Example| 	Same As|
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|= |	x = 5 | x = 5 	|
|+= |	x += 3| x = x + 3 |	
|-= |	x -= 3 |x = x - 3 |	
|*= |	x *= 3 	|x = x * 3 |	
|/= |	x /= 3 	|x = x / 3 	|
|%= |	x %= 3 	|x = x % 3 	|
|&= |	x &= 3 	|x = x & 3 	|
||= |	x |= 3 	|x = x | 3 	|
|^= |	x ^= 3 	|x = x ^ 3 	|
|>>= |	x >>= 3 |x = x >> 3 |	
|<<= |	x <<= 3 |x = x << 3 |	

## comparison operators

|Operator|Name|Example|
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|== |Equal to |	x == y 	|
|!= |Not equal |	x != y| 	
|> 	|Greater than |	x > y |	
|< 	|Less than |	x < y |	
|>= |Greater than or equal to |	x >= y| 	
|<= |Less than or equal to |	x <= y |	
## logical  operators
|Operator|Name|Description|Example|
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|&&  |	Logical and |	Returns true if both statements are true |	x |< 5 &&  x < 10 	|
|   |	Logical or |	Returns true if one of the statements is true |	x |< 5 || x < 4 |	
|! |	Logical not |	Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true |	!(x < 5 && x < 10) 	|
